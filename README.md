## Overview
This application simulates game of Chess. This application uses the React framework with Redux for state management. I use Redux to ensure that only the affected tiles re-render and not the entire chess board, which is impossible to do in react alone.

### Features that have been added
-The board and the chess pieces <br>
-Players take turns moving pieces <br>
-Players can move each piece and attack with them correctly <br>
-Pawn Promotion <br>
-The board recognizes when a Player has won <br>
-The board can be reset at any time by clicking the reset button

### Features that have yet to be added
-Two counters to keep track of wins <br>
-Special moves like En passant and Castling
