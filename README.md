## Overview
This application simulates a chess game, but currently it is in its infancy stage. This application uses the React framework with Redux for state management. I use Redux to ensure that only the affected tiles re-render and not the entire chess board, which is impossible to do in react alone.

### Features that have been added
-The board and the chess pieces <br>
-Players take turns moving pieces <br>
-Players can move pawns and attack with them correctly <br>
-Players can move other pieces but they can only move forward 1 tile and they can move from one end of the board if they reach the other end.

### The Application
You can view this application [here](https://ryanarine.github.io/Chess/).
